# Lightworks-Converter
Converts project files from the Lightworks video editor app over to other formats.

LW_ODB.py is the current main class. Does NOT take args; you need to edit the bottom. Can export to Final Cut 7 XML.
ed5decode.py can be used directly to create EDL or MLT files, though some this may no longer be working.

See references.txt for where I got my code.
